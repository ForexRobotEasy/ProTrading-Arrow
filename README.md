## Code Description

The ProTrading Arrow code is an expert advisor that aims to identify potential trend reversals in the forex market. It calculates the difference between the current and previous closing prices and determines if it exceeds a specified period for trend reversals.

### Input Parameters

- `ArrowPeriod` (default: 14): The period for calculating trend reversals.

### Global Variables

- `prevClose`: Stores the previous closing price.
- `currClose`: Stores the current closing price.
- `buySignal`: Indicates if a potential buy signal is present.
- `sellSignal`: Indicates if a potential sell signal is present.

### Initialization Function

The `OnInit()` function is responsible for initializing the expert advisor. It sets the initial values for `prevClose` and `currClose` based on the closing prices of the previous and current bars.

### Tick Function

The `OnTick()` function is called on each tick of the market. It updates the current and previous closing prices, calculates the trend reversal, and checks for potential buy or sell signals based on the ArrowPeriod.

If the trend reversal exceeds the ArrowPeriod, a buy signal is triggered, and the sell signal is reset. If the trend reversal is less than the negative ArrowPeriod, a sell signal is triggered, and the buy signal is reset.

The function then prints the buy or sell signal along with the symbol and current closing price.

### Deinitialization Function

The `OnDeinit()` function is called when the expert advisor is being removed. It performs any necessary cleanup tasks.
